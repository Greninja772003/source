1) ->Interface methods do not have a body - the body is provided by the "implement" class. On implementation of an
interface, you must override all of its methods. Interface methods are by default abstract and public.
Interface attributes are by default public , static and final.

2) ->When you run a function in child class and it exists in the parent class then during compile time both the classes
should be available while compilation process.

3) ->Interface contradict the basic hierarchy classification of method accessibility ,in Interface irrespective of the
position of a class any one can call any method/function wherever it is declared.

4) ->By using interface, two classes that are unrelated to each other can use share same method/function.
