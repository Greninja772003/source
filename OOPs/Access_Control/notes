In a class when a variable or any unit is declared as private then it can't be accessible for any other class or file
directly.

If a variable is declared as private in class then we can access it via getters and setters method/function .

Getters and Setters are worked like a constructors where getter hold accessing power of variable and setter can change
it's value according to our need.

When variables are declared as public in class then they can be accessible across their every package or folder, but
when nothing is mentioned than the variable can be accessible only for the same package classes but not for the other
folder packages.

Protected modifier are used to declare class or variable accessible for same class,package subclass of same pkg and
subclass of diff pkg.

Modifiers and their Accessibility :
a) "public" Modifier :- Applicable in :
-> Class file
-> Package file
-> Subclass (same pkg)
-> Subclass (diff pkg)
-> Everywhere (diff pkg & not subclass
b) "protected" Modifier :- Applicable in :
-> Class file
-> Package file
-> Subclass (same pkg)
-> Subclass (diff pkg)
c) No Modifier :- Applicable in :
-> Class file
-> Package file
-> Subclass (same pkg)
d) "private" Modifier :- Applicable in :
-> Class file

In different packages with Protected variable or class can only be accessible via creating their subclass.

[ if (obj.equals(obj2)){  System.out.println("obj is equal to obj2"); } ] .equals is a method/function which is used to
compare two entities the pre-defined functions.
